**Key Methodologies**

**1. Natural Language to SQL (Text-to-SQL)**

Text-to-SQL techniques enable users to interact with databases through natural language, converting queries into structured SQL commands. This approach reduces the technical barrier for database access and ensures intuitive user experiences.

- **Relevant Tools**: LangChain, OpenAI APIs, query validation mechanisms.
- **Applications**: Time-series database interaction for generating insights and reports.

**2. Graph-Based Reasoning**

Graph-based reasoning introduces the capability to analyze relationships among data points by using graph structures. This is particularly beneficial in handling complex queries and interconnected datasets.

- **Relevant Tools**: LangGraph.
- **Applications**: Dependency tracking, advanced query resolution, and relationship-based decision-making.

**3. SQL-Based Technical Indicators**

SQL-based computations of technical indicators such as Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are crucial for analyzing time-series data.

- **Applications**: Financial analytics, trading systems, and performance monitoring.
